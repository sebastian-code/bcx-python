@summary:   Basecamp command line main lib to query the service API.
            This library does not implement CRUD with the API, it only makes
            GET calls.
@note:		This client works with basic authentication, the OAuth
            authentication is not implemented, mainly due to my interest in a
            tool that allows me to extract information to create my own
            dashboard and reporting tool, because basecamp has none, and in it's
            origin, the tool is conceived as an individual usage tool.
