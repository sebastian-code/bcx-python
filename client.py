@summary:   Basecamp command line client to query the service API.
            This client is not originaly intended to implement CRUD,
            only implements the GET HTTP verb.
@note:      This client works with basic authentication, the OAuth
            authentication is not implemented, mainly due to my interest in a
            tool that allows me to extract information to create my own
            dashboard and reporting tool, because basecamp has none.
